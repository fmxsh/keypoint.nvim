# Keypoint - keybinder and proxy plugin for nvim

> [!NOTE]
> Not adapted for public usability. Integrated into my personal setup.

This plugin can wipe all keybindings in Neovim and redefine them. However, my use evolved to let the default keys be, and instead override whatever keys I desire to redefine.

This plugin is mainly used to define keys that are subject to be leader keys for subsequently dynamically bound keys. Not sure I remember this correctly.

It is part of the 3 or 4 corner stones of my personal project manager.

The plugin spec part is configuation heavy.

The concept is good, but the code needs a lot of work to clean up and standardize.
